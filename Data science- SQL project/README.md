## IPL Auction 

### Motive
Developing auction strategy for new IPL franchise by analyzing past IPL data to create a strong and balanced squad
### Background story
Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities or states in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of IPL in 2020 was estimated to be around â‚¹475 billion (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps. 
The IPL tournament involves each team playing every other team twice in a home-and-away, double round-robin format. At the conclusion of the double round-robin league, on the basis of aggregate points, the top four teams qualify for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualifies for the final match, the losing team gets another chance to qualify for the final match by playing the winning team of the Eliminator match; this match is titled Qualifier 2. The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match moves onto the final match. The team that wins the final match is crowned the Indian Premier League champion. 
Altogether, thirteen teams have played in the past ten seasons of the IPL tournament.] Of these, five teams are no longer a part of the tournament. In 2011, BCCI terminated the franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for contractual breach Similarly, BCCI terminated the franchise of Deccan Chargers in 2012 for backing off from its commitments. In 2013, Pune Warriors India exited IPL after it had a franchise valuation disagreement with BCCI. Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were suspended in 2015 & 2016 following a betting controversy. However, in July 2017, BCCI announced that both Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals would be allowed back into the IPL competition from the 2018 season. The tournament featured eight teams for the 2020 season, including Delhi Capitals. Punjab Kings, Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians. Mumbai Indians have won five titles. Chennai Super Kings have won four titles and Kolkata Knight Riders have won two titles, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Gujarat Titans and Rajasthan Royals, apart from former team Deccan Chargers, are the other teams to have won the tournament title. In a coming season a new team is being added to the Indian Premier League (IPL) and a mega auction is being held to build the team's squad, there are a few factors that the team's management and auction strategy would likely consider:
 1. Budget: The team would need to allocate a budget for the auction and decide how much money to spend on each player. 
2. Team needs: The team would need to identify the positions and types of players they need to fill out their squad and target those players in the auction. 
3. Player availability: The team would need to assess the availability of players, including their current contracts with other teams and their international commitments. 
4. Player form: The team would need to consider the recent form and performances of the players they are targeting. 
5. Player value: The team would need to consider the market value of the players they are interested in and decide how much they are willing to pay for them. 
To build a strong and balanced squad, the team's management would likely need to strike a balance between all of these factors and come up with a well-thought-out auction strategy. This could involve targeting a few key players they consider to be game-changers, while also filling out the rest of the squad with more affordable players who can add value to the team. It could also involve making use of the various player retention and right to match options available to them. 
As the data analysis team leader of this new team, your first step would be to gather and analyze all available data on the players who are eligible for selection in the auction. This could include data on their past performance in domestic and international cricket, their current form and fitness, and any other relevant metrics such as fielding ability, bowling economy, and strike rate. 
Once you have gathered and analyzed this data, you can use it to create player profiles and rankings for all of the eligible players. This would involve assigning a value or rating to each player based on their performance and potential impact on the team. 
Using these player profiles and rankings, you can work with the team's management to create a list of target players for the auction. This list would include players who we believe would be the best value for money and who would fill the specific needs of our team. 
Finally, you would work with the team's auction strategy group to come up with a plan for the auction itself. This would involve deciding on the order in which we want to bid for players, setting limits on the amount we are willing to pay for each player, and making use of any player retention or right to match options we may have.
